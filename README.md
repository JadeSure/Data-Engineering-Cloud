## What's different between two models: Inmon and Kimball？ 
Inmon model needs a long term to build the system from different data source (OLTP) to create data warehouse, which can be used by different department(data mart) to use the model.
drawback: 
Kimball model based on application to look for needed data from data source. more dynamic.
## OLTP and OLAP？
OLTP: Online Transaction Processing, for RDBMS: increase, modify, delete, check(search)
OLAP: On-Line Analytical Processing, for Data warehouse
## data mart?
prepared the data for relative applications, which will be used directly.
## What does Data Lake mean？
Do not care data categories when it loaded data, which is used in machine learning. 
## IaaS，PaaS，SaaS ？ 
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service PaaS: Platform as a Service SaaS: Software as a Service 
## The feature of DBMS: what is ACID ？ meaning？ 
ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Isolation)  
Atomicity (Abort/commit) only have this two status, True or False. eg.  all the instructions within a transaction will successfully execute, or none of them will execute;  
Consistency: The database must be consistent before and after the transaction;  
Isolation: Multiple transactions occur independently without interference;  
Durability: The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs. For instance, if Bob’s account contains $120, this information should not disappear upon hardware or software failure.

## The relationship of group, user, policy and role?
One group has many users, which has the permission to access other services.  
policy is formated as json type that writes the limitation for applications. (The mininum unit) It gives permissions to what a user/Group/Role is able to do.  
Role is for AWS service to service.

## What does programmatic access? what should provide?
Enables an access key ID and secret access key for the AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools. this can be used in scripts and thus to automate processes and actions. Can get autogenerated password or custom password.

## what does console access? the function of MFA?
Console access: Controlling user access to the AWS Management Console (AWS console login);
MFA: Multi-factor authentication, it use to increase the security of your AWS environments. Signing in to MFA-protected accounts requires a user name, password, and an authentication code from an MFA device.

## The type of permission policy? what does that present? what does least privillage?
Permission policy has three kinds of types, predefined aws policy, customerised policy(by yourself) and inline policy(only use once).  
Least privillage: As a best practice, define permissions for only specific
resources in specific accounts. Alternatively, you can grant least privilege
using condition keys.

## Can I install database in S3?
No. S3 bucket is not a file system. Everything in the S3 is seen as an object.

## What does key mean in S3? Value mean in S3?
Key is an object name. s3 bucket is the unique domain name + file name.  
value is an object. Every file in the S3 is an object.

## Where can I implement S3 in Inmon and Kimball.
In the OLTP data Sources part. Because S3 can be access easily without file size limitaion, which can be used to store the initial data from any source. Then, we can set an alert or lamda to reminder or automatic operation data processing in the next part.
