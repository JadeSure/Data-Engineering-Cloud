## What's different between two models: Inmon and Kimball？ 
Inmon model needs a long term to build the system from different data source (OLTP) to create data warehouse, which can be used by different department(data mart) to use the model.
drawback: 
Kimball model based on application to look for needed data from data source. more dynamic.
## OLTP and OLAP？
OLTP: Online Transaction Processing, for RDBMS: increase, modify, delete, check(search)
OLAP: On-Line Analytical Processing, for Data warehouse
## data mart?
prepared the data for relative applications, which will be used directly.
## What does Data Lake mean？
Do not care data categories when it loaded data, which is used in machine learning. 
## IaaS，PaaS，SaaS ？ 
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service PaaS: Platform as a Service SaaS: Software as a Service 
## The feature of DBMS: what is ACID ？ meaning？ 
ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Isolation)  
Atomicity (Abort/commit) only have this two status, True or False. eg.  all the instructions within a transaction will successfully execute, or none of them will execute;  
Consistency: The database must be consistent before and after the transaction;  
Isolation: Multiple transactions occur independently without interference;  
Durability: The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs. For instance, if Bob’s account contains $120, this information should not disappear upon hardware or software failure.

## The relationship of group, user, policy and role?
One group has many users, which has the permission to access other services.  
policy is formated as json type that writes the limitation for applications. (The mininum unit) It gives permissions to what a user/Group/Role is able to do.  
Role is for AWS service to service.

## What does programmatic access? what should provide?
Enables an access key ID and secret access key for the AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools. this can be used in scripts and thus to automate processes and actions. Can get autogenerated password or custom password.

## what does console access? the function of MFA?
Console access: Controlling user access to the AWS Management Console (AWS console login);
MFA: Multi-factor authentication, it use to increase the security of your AWS environments. Signing in to MFA-protected accounts requires a user name, password, and an authentication code from an MFA device.

## The type of permission policy? what does that present? what does least privillage?
Identity Based Permission: Permission policy has three kinds of types:  
Predefined aws policy(management aws policy), can only be read. It cannot be modified.  
Customerised policy(by yourself requirements to define a policy).  
Inline policy(only use once, cannot be checked by other identity), 
Least privillage: As a best practice, define permissions for only specific
resources in specific accounts. Alternatively, you can grant least privilege
using condition keys.  
### Advanced permissions
Resource based permission, eg. bucket permission with other services;  
Session based permission, eg. visit a website with token based on session time;  

## Different between DATABASE and DBMS?
DBMS: Database Management System. DBMS eg. mysql, mssql --> database： increase, delete, modify, query.

## Can I install database in S3?
No. S3 bucket is not a file system. Everything in the S3 is seen as an object.  
S3 cannot be a database, but it can store data.

## What does key mean in S3? Value mean in S3?
Key is an object name. s3 bucket is the unique domain name + file name.  
value is an object. Every file in the S3 is an object.

## Where can I implement S3 in Inmon and Kimball.
Where Inmon and Kimball is a DBMS. structured data

In the OLTP data Sources part. Because S3 can be access easily without file size limitaion, which can be used to store the initial(middle) data from any source. Then, we can set an alert or lambda to reminder or automatic operation data processing in the next part. Besides, it can store NoSQL data, such as video, audio, pictures...  
another example, lambda read data from s3 --> save it into aws database
Can store data rather than build database system in the S3.

## Implementation codes in EC2
### connect to the ec2 server
`ssh -i my-first-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-25-179-100.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

### check ec2 describe (AWS command line)
`aws ec2 describe-instances --region ap-southeast-2`

### check aws configure
`aws configure
		- access key ID
		- access key
		- region name
		- output formate`

### check available s3 bucket
`aws s3 ls`

### copy files from s3 to EC2
`aws s3 cp --recursive [name of bucket eg. s3://] [local address eg. /home/ec2-user]`

### terminate your aws instance
`aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids [your id]`

## The process of building a server host in the EC2?
`sudo yum update  
sudo su  
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html/
vi index.html (edit in vim)
service httpd start`

## How many kinds of Load Balancer?
• Application Load Balancer (http and https traffic): according the
traffic load to leading different server(In the application layer, Layer 7).  
• Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP traffic): leading the traffic to the
server which have higher capacity in the transfer layer (Layer 4),
use for extreme performance.  
• Classic Load Balancer: can use http/https and TCP traffic by X-Forwarded and sticky seesions.

## What does X-Forwarded and sticky sessions?
Due to internal servers they communicate with their private IP address(internal network),
X-Forwarded helps the server when they need to identify the original
request source (public IP address).  
Known the original request source can help us to do some basic data
analysis, such as geographic location or orgnasation’s name.  
Sticky sessions: each request come from the same source can be hosted
into the same server. Disadvantage: can cause load unbalanced because of keeping to connect to this server.

## What is the risk of using aws configure to save credentials?
For security reason, can not store credentials in ec2 instance, that will
cause huge loss. Using roles in this way has several benefits. Because role
credentials are temporary and rotated automatically, you don't have to
manage credentials, and you don't have to worry about long-term
security risks. In addition, if you use a single role for multiple instances,
you can make a change to that one role and the change is propagated
automatically to all the instances.

## If it contains aws configure and EC2 instance role to access S3, which one has a higher priority?
IAM role. When an IAM role is attached to the instance, the AWS CLI
automatically and securely retrieves the credentials from the instance
metadata.  
Using roles to grant permissions to applications that run on EC2
instances requires a bit of extra configuration. An application running on
an EC2 instance is abstracted from AWS by the virtualized operating
system. Because of this extra separation, an additional step is needed to
assign an AWS role and its associated permissions to an EC2 instance and
make them available to its applications. This extra step is the creation of
an instance profile that is attached to the instance. The instance profile
contains the role and can provide the role's temporary credentials to an
application that runs on the instance. Those temporary credentials can
then be used in the application's API calls to access resources and to
limit access to only those resources that the role specifies. Note that
only one role can be assigned to an EC2 instance at a time, and all
applications on the instance share the same role and permissions.
